# Supplemental Lessons Repository

Welcome to the **Supplemental Lessons Repository**! This collection contains all the supplemental lessons I have created as a remote instructor at [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org). These materials are designed to enhance and deepen understanding of key concepts taught in The Last Mile coding program.

## Purpose

The lessons in this repository:
- Are **original works** created entirely by me.
- Align with topics taught in The Last Mile coding program but do **not infringe** on The Last Mile's curriculum or LMS.
- Aim to provide additional practice and insight into the concepts covered during the program.

## Contents

Each lesson is structured to support independent and guided learning. Typical lesson materials include:
- **Markdown Files** (`student.md` and `instructor.md`): Provide a clear breakdown of the lesson for both students and instructors.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript Examples**: Demonstrates practical implementations of key concepts.
- **Challenges and Extensions**: Encourage deeper exploration of the topic.

### Example Topics
- DOM Manipulation
- Form Handling and Validation
- Arrays and Data Storage
- JavaScript `this` Keyword
- React Components and State Management

## Usage

These lessons are intended to:
- Supplement the instruction provided in The Last Mile coding program.
- Encourage self-paced learning and skill-building.
- Serve as inspiration for additional lesson development.
